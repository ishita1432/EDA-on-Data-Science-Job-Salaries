## Project Overview

In today's rapidly evolving job market, Data Science is one of the most sought-after fields. Understanding the salary trends in Data Science can be crucial for job seekers and employers alike. This project aims to answer questions such as:

- What is the average salary for Data Science jobs?
- How do salaries vary by location, experience level, employment type, and job role?
- Which are the most trending job titles in the field of Data?
- To address these questions, we have analyzed a dataset of Data Science job postings and salaries.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is available in  [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023). It includes information about job postings, such as job title, location, company, experience level, education requirements, and salary.

## Analysis and Visualizations

We have performed an in-depth analysis of the dataset and created various visualizations using Seaborn. Some of the key visualizations include:

- Distribution of Data Science salaries.
- Salary trends by experience level, and employment type.
- Salary distribution across different job titles.
- Geographic distribution of salaries.

## Tableau Dashboard

We created a Tableau dashboard to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring the salary data. The dashboard allows users to filter and drill down into the data, gaining valuable insights at their fingertips. You can access the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ishita.sharma7620/viz/Datasciencejobsalaries_16935291280440/DatasciencejobsalariesDashboard).
