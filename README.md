## Project Overview

In today's rapidly evolving job market, Data Science is one of the most sought-after fields. Understanding the salary trends in Data Science can be crucial for job seekers and employers alike. This project aims to answer questions such as:

- What is the average salary for Data Science jobs?
- How do salaries vary by location, experience, and education?
- Which industries offer the highest salaries for Data Scientists?
- To address these questions, we have gathered and analyzed a dataset of Data Science job postings and salaries.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is available in the [data](data/) directory. It includes information about job postings, such as job title, location, company, experience level, education requirements, and salary.

## Analysis and Visualizations

We have performed in-depth analysis on the dataset and created various visualizations using Seaborn. Some of the key visualizations include:

- Distribution of Data Science salaries.
- Salary trends by experience level.
- Salary distribution across different job titles.
- Geographic distribution of salaries.

You can find these visualizations in the [notebooks](notebooks/) directory.

## Tableau Dashboard

To provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for exploring the salary data, we have created a Tableau dashboard. The dashboard allows users to filter and drill down into the data, gaining valuable insights at their fingertips. You can access the dashboard [here]([tableau/dashboard.twbx](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ishita.sharma7620/viz/Datasciencejobsalaries_16935291280440/DatasciencejobsalariesDashboard)).
